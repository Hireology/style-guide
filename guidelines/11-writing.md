## Web Components

### Buttons

Button text should always be the action you want users to take, such as Log In, Sign Up, Schedule Interview. Please don't use 'Click Here!' as button text. Button text should always be title case and avoid punctuation.

Example:

- Good: “Preview Job Post”
- Bad: “Click to preview job post!”

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes should use sentence case.

### Form labels

Form labels should be short and directly describe the information being requested. Labels should use sentence case. 

### Form placeholders

Placeholders should help users see an example of what they need to input in the form field. Depending on the context you can make these playful in tone. Placeholders should use sentence case. 

### Select menus

Select menus should use sentence case in most cases, with the exception of countries and other proper nouns.

### Radio buttons

Radio buttons should use sentence case.

### Dropdowns

Dropdown items should use title case.

### Headings

Headings and subheadings are used to help organize content and tell users what they are about to read or experience. Use your headings and subheadings in a sensible hierarchy (H1 - H6) to help the user easily navigate the page or article. Headings should be title case, unless they are written as a punctuated sentence. Subheadings should always be sentence case. 

### Links

Links should be used when referring to internal web pages or external websites. Avoid phrases like "Click here" or "Read this." Write the sentence as you normally would and then link the relevant keywords. If the link comes at the end of a sentence or after a comma, do not link the punctuation mark. 

Example:

- Good: “To learn what makes a great job description, [view our job posting guide](#).”
- Bad: “[Click here](#) to read what makes a new hire a standout employee.”

### Navigation

Main and subnavigation should use title case. Make sure to keep them clear and concise.

### Tables

Table headers should use title case. 

## Grammar & Usage

### Abbreviations and acronyms

It can be tempting to shorten words to save space, but if there is a chance that your reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym at first glance, always spell it out on first mention. 

Example:

- First Use: National Automobile Dealers Association
- Second Use: NADA
- First Use: Applicant Tracking System
- Second Use: ATS

Abbreviations and acronyms that are easily recognizable such as HR or DVD do not need to be spelled out. 

### Active Voice

Always try to write with an active voice, where the subject of the sentence performs the action. In a sentence written in a passive voice, the subject receives the action which can feel clunky and awkward.

#### Examples:

- Active voice: Margot scheduled the interview.
- Passive voice: The interview was scheduled by Margot.  
- Active voice: Select a hiring process before moving to the next step.
- Passive voice: A hiring process must be selected before moving before moving to the next step.

One tip to recognize which voice you’re using is to insert the phrase “by zombies” after the verb. If the sentence still makes sense, you’re using the passive voice.

In some cases the action will be more important than the subject. This is an exception where it is ok to use the passive voice.

Example:

- Your interview was rescheduled by the hiring manager. 

### Capitalization

For content like buttons, form labels, and table headers use title case, where the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions is capitalized.

Example:

- Open a Job
- First Name
- Save and Exit

Most other content will use sentence case, where the first word of the sentence is capitalized. This includes body copy and form placeholder text.

Example:

- Add comment here

Some words should never be capitalized in a sentence:

- website
- internet
- email
- email addresses: admin@hireology.com
- job family
- hiring process

Never add emphasis to your writing by capitalizing every letter in a word. NO ONE LIKES FEELING LIKE THEY ARE BEING YELLED AT.

### Contractions

Contractions are a great way to keep your tone friendly. We want our readers to remember that they are communicating with real people, so use them as you see fit.  

### Numbers, dates, and times

#### Numbers

In body copy, spell out numbers one through nine. Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater.  Follow the same convention for ordinals. Numbers over three decimals should use commas. 

Example:   

- Five Hireologists participated in the 10th annual chili competition.
- Last week we had 3,456 new applicants.

#### Dates
In most cases, spell out the day of the week and abbreviate the month, unless you’re just referring to the month or the month and the year.

Example:

- Saturday, Jan 24
- Saturday, Jan 24, 2015
- January 2015

In the app interface, dates should be formatted with an abbreviated month without a period, numeral day, and full year when necessary for context. 

Example:

- Jan 20, 2016
- Nov 15, 2015

#### Percentages

Avoid using the % symbol unless you are using a standalone percentage in the app interface. In body copy, spell out the word “percent.” 

#### Telephone Numbers

You don’t need to get fancy with phone numbers. Write them with hyphens and use country codes if your reader is in another country.

Example:

- 555-532-4321
- +1-555-234-5678

#### Times

Use lowercase numerals without a space for am and pm. Use minutes for all times, even if it is on the hour. 

Example:

- 3:00pm
- 9:30am

Use a hyphen in between times to indicate a range. 

Example:

- 3:00pm - 4:00pm

### Punctuation

#### Bulleted Lists

Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Only use a period if the list item is a full sentence.

#### Colons

Use a colon when you need to offset a list of items.

Example:

- This month we will be hiring for three positions: sales manager, customer service representative, and an account.

#### Commas

Use the serial or Oxford comma.  Otherwise, follow common sense with commas. Read the sentence out loud. If you need to take a breath, use a comma.

Example:

- This year we will be focusing hiring efforts in Chicago, New York, and Atlanta.

#### Ellipses

Ellipses (...)  should only be used to show that you are trailing off before finishing a sentence, and therefore should be used very rarely. Please avoid using them for drama or emphasis. 

#### Exclamation marks

Try to avoid too much of a good thing by using exclamation points sparingly. Never use them in error messages or alerts. 

#### Quotes, accents, and dashes

Please follow [these guidelines](http://quotesandaccents.com/) and make sure you type them correctly.
