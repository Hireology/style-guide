Hireology helps business owners build successful companies by assembling better teams. Every piece of content we publish should strive to do these things:

- Empower
- Educate
- Support
- Empathize 

## The Basics

- Be clear.
- Be concise.
- Sound human.
- Be honest.
- Be kind.

## Voice & Tone

Many people use the terms voice and tone  interchangeably, but they aren’t really the same thing. Our voice is what we consider our public personality. It should be consistent day to day, and shine through all of our content. It helps our readers feel like they are interacting with a familiar face.

Our tone, on the other hand, should change depending on the situation. This is more about understanding how your readers might feel and responding appropriately at any time.  

### Our Voice

Enthusiastic, but not annoying.

Expert, but not elite.

Conversational, but not inappropriate. 

Supportive, but not overbearing.

Informal, but not unprofessional. 

### Our Tone
